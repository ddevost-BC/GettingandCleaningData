# JHU - Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
D. Devost

This repo contains the required files - R script, ReadMe, and Codebook - for the course project.

## Overview

The task of the course project is to exhibit the collection of data and cleaning of that data to form a tidy data set used in further analysis.
For additional information of the data set used visit - <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones">The UCI Machine Learning Project</a>.

The actual source data can be downloaded from <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">here</a>.

## Project Instructions

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that:
*  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
*  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
*  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Notes
1) If you choose to replicate the tidy data set you will need download the original data set to your working directory and then modify the R code to identigy your working dierctory. 


## Additional Information
More information about the variable definintions can be found in the Codebook.md file.
